# `<Title>`-—-News-Analysis

## Report-metadata

| Field | Value | Hint |
| ----- | ----- | ---- |
| Report Type | `news-analysis` | Fixed for this template — emitted as `report_types: ["news-analysis"]` |
| Title | | Prefix with **your member namespace token** (§4.2) — e.g. `acme-`. Pick it once; it is stable forever |
| Published | | **Stable anchor date.** Dedup is name + published (§9.2), so a date that changes on revision forks a new report |
| TLP | | `Clear` \| `Green` \| `Amber` \| `Amber+Strict` \| `Red` (TLP 2.0, §8.1). `Clear` was called `White` and keeps the same STIX id; `Amber+Strict` withdraws the client carve-out and is dual-marked with `Amber` |
| Author | | **Your member identity** — becomes `created_by_ref` (§8.2) |
| Source Reliability | | Admiralty `A`–`F` |
| Info Credibility | | Admiralty `1`–`6` |
| Threat level | | `High` \| `Medium` \| `Low` (§3.4) — urgency and proximity, **not** a confidence grade. Emitted as `threat_level` in the Patchwork extension ([9.3](../Patchwork-CTI-Framework.md#93-classification-properties)) |
| Threat domain | | `Constituency` \| `National` \| `Regional` \| `Partner` \| `World` (§3.3). Highest applicable rung wins. Emitted as `threat_domain` in the Patchwork extension ([9.3](../Patchwork-CTI-Framework.md#93-classification-properties)) |
| Activity category | | One or more of the nine categories in §5.2 — emitted as `activity_category` in the Patchwork extension ([9.3](../Patchwork-CTI-Framework.md#93-classification-properties)) |
| Observed date | | **Required where this report records an incident.** When the activity was *observed*, not when this was written. It contributes to the incident's identity key (§9.2), so a wrong date forks a duplicate rather than updating. Emitted as `observed_date` in the Patchwork extension ([9.3](../Patchwork-CTI-Framework.md#93-classification-properties)) |

## Objects-referenced

> [!TIP] What goes here
> What belongs in this report's `object_refs` so the narrative and the STIX container agree. For `news-analysis`: whichever entities the reporting concerns; keep the container honest about what is unconfirmed.
